Ugh, you're a monster
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby

The Brain Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the
Hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)
